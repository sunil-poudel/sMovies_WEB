1. project/views.py
    def base(request):
        logo = AppAssets.objects.get(id=7)
        context = {'logo':logo}
        return render(request, "base.html", context)

2. base.html
    <img src="{{ logo.logos.url }}" alt="logo of sMovies" style="height:30px; width:30px; border-radius:50%">

3. What we did here is, base of views.py had no usages from urls.py
but still, we could pass logo through it as context and render to base.html
so it means if we have to pass some data as context without damaging url,
we can create custom views, pass data through it as context and render them in
required html without any worries.
